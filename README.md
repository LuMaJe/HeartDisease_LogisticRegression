# Predicting Heart Disease - Logistic Regression Model

## Project Description

### Overview

As part of my Data Analytics course at Turing College, I was tasked with creating a logistic regression model. The model was to class patient data as those who are or are not at risk of developing Coronary Heart Disease within the next 10 years.


### Techniques demonstrated

* Python
* Logistic Regression Modelling
* Awareness of statistical methodology
* Data visualisation
* Data Pre-processing / Cleaning
* EDA
* Feature selection
* Thresholding

### Insights

The final model created managed to achieve an AUC score of between 0.72-0.74. Overall, due to the healthcare/medical related data, priority was given to the Recall score as an important evaluation metric. The model achieved a Recall score of 0.79 while maintaining the number of False positives below that of the number of True negatives.

## Personal Reflections

This project occurred relatively early on in my Analytics course, and my first attempt at the model was definitely not as good as this one here. I kept practising modelling on various other projects and eventually started to understand the process better and better each time. I feel there is still plenty of room for improvement. I would like to see a higher AUC score, somewhere > 0.80 would be ideal. I am also interested in trying out the SMOTE package to rebalance the data as in this case the data was highly imbalanced. Overall though, I feel as though I learned a great deal about the importance of statistical awareness when working with data, the importance of underlying distributions and the role of significance also. It was also interesting to understand the nuances of which metrics are prioritised depwnding on the context of the data. I'm still very eager to improve my modelling abilities, both within regression (Logistic and Linear) as well as other more complex models.
